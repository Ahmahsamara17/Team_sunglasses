Functionality like `substr` isn't just for filtering: you can also `SELECT` expressions such as these (in place of or in addition to where you typically specify columns)!
This is super handy when you don't want (or, in the case of this challenge, cannot retrieve) _all_ the data, but just want the result of some computation on your data.
In this case, the challenge will simply not let you read the whole flag.
Can you read it piecemeal?
